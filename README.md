Live site hosted on [Azure](https://lively-sand-0b10d851e.4.azurestaticapps.net/QRCodeWiFi.html) using their "free for hobby use" plan.

This very simple HTML web page generates correct QR codes for Wi-Fi networks.

Unlike some other pages this one generates a "foldable" style QR code page, like you'd see at the front desk of a coffee shop or hotel. The output doesn't include any kind of branding for this generator site, and the site contains no ads or tracking (at least, none that I added -- if the Azure hosting does something, that's something I don't know about).
